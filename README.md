# go.h
A collection of go structs and fuctions I made that I often need for projects multiple uses, therefor this whole repo is just one big ".h" header file, but for go.  
Thus far, this repo contains:
* omap.go - Ordered Map. A Map but implemented with a binary tree
* umap.go - Unordered Map. A Map but implemened with a hash table
* linked-list.go - I think you get the idea
* bst.go - Binary Search Tree
* stack.go - Stack Data Structure using FILO
* queue.go - Queue Data Structure using FIFO
* merge.go - Merge Sort
* bucket.go - Bucket Sort that utilizes Merge Sort
